ðŸ“„ Description

This C program is a **menu-driven console application** that displays population statistics for the **top 20 most populous countries** in the world.

When the program runs:

* It presents a **numbered list (1â€“20)** of countries.
* The user is prompted to **enter a rank number** corresponding to a country.
* Based on the selected rank, the program uses a **`switch` statement** to display:

  * Total population
  * Yearly population growth rate
  * Net population change

This project demonstrates the use of:

* **Conditional control structures** (`switch-case`)
* **User input/output** using `scanf()` and `printf()`
* **Basic menu systems** in C programming

### ðŸ’» Features

* Simple, text-based interface
* Fixed population data for 20 countries
* Clean country selection using numbers
* Great for **beginners** learning control structures and input handling in C

---

### âš  Limitations

* Uses **outdated Turbo C functions** (`clrscr()` and `getch()`), which don't work in modern compilers
* The population data is **hardcoded**, not fetched dynamically
* No input validation or loop to allow multiple selections
